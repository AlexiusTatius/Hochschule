## Ideas and Ways to Build this Project

1. Build a basic server that can handle requests and responses.
2. Build a basic client that can send requests and receive responses.
3. Your first goal is to send file from the client to the server. First store that in the server's local memory and then store it in the database of MongoDB.
8. Your second goal is to fetch that file from the server to the client, of course we are storing it in the local memory first, then we'll move on to MongoDB.
9. Middleware to check if the user is authenticated or not, would be handled later.
10. Authentication and Authorization of the client would be done using JWT but that part would be handled later.


## Plan 2
1. You shall build the basic file transfer.
2. Then you should implement multer.
